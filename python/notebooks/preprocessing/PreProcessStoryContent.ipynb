No, it was not Losar, the New Year festival. That was many months away. Nor was it any special day in her village, like the gonpa festival, or a wedding day. Today was going to be Chuskit's first day at school. At nine years, she had waited a long, long time for this. The school was not very far away from her home.

       "2      Everytime I finish my hot, hot bath, My wet body feels so cool, cool cool. Who makes that happen? Vayu the Wind! The milk in my cup is too hot, too hot. But soon it is ready for me to gulp. Who makes that happen? Vayu the Wind! The window curtains flutter And gently brush my face. Who makes it happen? Vayu, the Wind! A bolt of lightning far away. Black clouds moving my way. Who makes that happen? Vayu, the Wind! Branches sway and leaves tremble. Flowers gently fall. Who did it all? Vayu, the Wind! Far from the house, we are playing, Yet, I can smell the sweets mother is preparing. Who makes it happen? Vayu, the Wind! A glass tumbler on a window sill, Crashes on the ground. Thank God, I was not around. Who played this mischief? Of course, it was Vayu, the Wind! A whistle blows. A train rolls in. I cannot see, but I hear its din. Who makes that happen? Vayu, the Wind! Cannot be seen Cannot be heard Does all the work Without a word. Who can it be? Of course! The wind! Vayu, the wind!  \n",
       "3  Chuskit woke up early that morning. It was a very special day and she was too excited to sleep. She eagerly looked out of the room through the window next to her bed. It was spring time in Ladakh and the apricot trees were in full bloom. Two magpies had already begun their day and were busy looking for insects to eat. Her Ama-ley was awake too. She could hear her in the kitchen making gur-gur tea. Chuskit had been awake for the last hour. This was a day she was going to remember for a long time. Can you guess why? No, it was not Losar, the New Year festival. That was many months away. Nor was it any special day in her village, like the gonpa festival, or a wedding day. Today was going to be Chuskit's first day at school. At nine years, she had waited a long, long time for this. The school was not very far away from her home. To get there, you had to walk up to the main road. Just before the prayer wheel, you took the path to the left of the road that ran along a narrow stream. Near...  \n",

I asked Ajja, “May I go out to play with my friends?” “Not now, beta. Maybe after your nap?”But I did not want to wait till after my nap. I asked Ma, “May I wear these new clothes?” “Not now, beta, you can wear them when we go out.” But I did not want to wait till we went out. I asked Papa, “May I open that nice looking box?” “Not now, not now. You must wait.” But I did not want to wait any more. Why do big people always say, ‘Not now, not now’? That night, I went to sleep feeling angry. The next day, I woke up early and went into the kitchen. Ajji said, “You can eat these laddoos now.” Ajja said, “We can play cricket now.” Ma said, “You can wear these clothes now.” Papa said, “You can open this box now.” And they all said, “Happy birthday!”  "
